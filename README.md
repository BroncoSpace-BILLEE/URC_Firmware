# BILLEE Firmware
Contains all firmware written for BILLEE to be used in Teensy 4.0 and 4.1 microcontrollers. Each folder is a seperate program used in the Arduino IDE and may contain multiple files. 
The library folder contains all the libraries used, and should be installed with any program used.

Currently, the only script in use on the 2025 rover is "billee_odrive_serial_and_RC_contorl"
